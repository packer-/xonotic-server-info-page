# xonotic-server-info-page
A boilerplate for setting up an informational page for your Xonotic game server.

Everything here is intended to be client-side code, meaning you can even put your server's webpage on github.io!

[Future] Features Include:
* Live information about your server (querying the master server list with javascript)
* An IRC widget to allow users to chat with your IRC channel from the page
* More
